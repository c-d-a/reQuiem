reQuiem
=======

reQuiem is a custom OpenGL Quake engine for Windows and Linux.

It is based on JoeQuake and was developed by jdhack. [Read more](https://www.quaddicted.com/engines/requiem).

It happens to run Nehahra reasonably well, so that's this fork's main focus: filing off some remaining rough edges. Feel free to submit bugs if you find any, but extra features (BSP2, CSQC, physics independence, etc) are beyond the scope here.
